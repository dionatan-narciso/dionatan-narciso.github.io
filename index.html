      <h2 class="subtittle">Amazing Places</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        The first place of my list is China, it is definitely one of the most
        diverse countries that I have been. From big and developed cities to
        places forgotten in ruins and forests. China is surprisingly a very
        organised country with an amazing public transport and despite having
        almost 1.5 billion people you will hardly see a crowd as everything
        works underground.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        The second place is Hong Kong, one of the most crowded but yet
        fascinating cities in the world. Hong Kong is full of life at all times,
        everything is open 24h/7 and you will find very nice markets on the
        street with amazing “very cheap” stuff and diverse food.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Last but not least is my home country Brazil. There you will find the
        most accommodating people in the whole world and amazing places to go.
        Brazil has beautiful beaches with white sand and breath-taking forests
        and waterfalls. From south to north you will likely find yourself
        feeling like you are in a different country as Brazil has a huge
        diversity of culture including German and Italian immigrants on south to
        African and Portuguese on north. I would also recommend everyone to try
        the Brazilian cosine as it is unique and very local depending on where
        in the country you are.
