        <strong>Neuroplasticity</strong>
      </h2>
      <p class="p">
        Neuroplasticity is the practice of doing something mentally or
        physically and teaching that particular area of your brain to involve
        itself. In studies the practice of Neuroplasticity shows that the brain
        is like a muscle and it can be stretched and refined. <br />
        The most important is that we are all capable of learning anything, with
        a lot of mental and physical practice your brain can be adjust do the
        new challenges.

        <strong>Growth Mindset</strong>
      </h2>
      <p class="p">
        Growth Mindset is the ability to think that you are capable of doing
        something you do not understand yet, it is allowing your brain to think
        that you are able to achieve something with a lot of effort and a
        positive mindset, and with patience and time that will happen.

        <strong>Learning Plan and Strategies</strong>
      </h2>
      <p class="p">
        I believe that is only natural to feel frustrated for things that I
        cannot yet understand. My plan is to practice every day, read and try to
        understand that thing might not come as easily as I once though they
        would but,<br />
        this shouldnâ€™t be something negative. I am sure with a lot of effort,
        practice and a growth mindset we all can get there.
