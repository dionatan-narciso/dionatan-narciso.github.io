        <strong>Identity, Values, and Strengths</strong>
      </h1>
    </div>
    <br />

      <h2 class="h2">
        <strong
          >1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision and
          how you reflect on the decision now.</strong
        >
      </h2>

      <p class="p">
        The hardest decision I record making was moving to another country, I
        was doing university at the time and the English language was very
        important for my career at the moment. <br />
        Moving away from everyone that I love was not easy but necessary for my
        person and professional growth and my family has always encourage me to
        follow my dreams and work hard for what I believe.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2">
        <strong
          >2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have
          influenced your values and identity.</strong
        >
      </h2>

      <p class="p">
        My family have always worked really hard to achieve what they want, I’ve
        always been taught that nothing comes for free and that dreams will
        always be achieved with hard work, knowledge and honesty. <br />
        Those are very important values for me that most certainly were passed
        from my parents to whom I am today.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2">
        <strong
          >1. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.</strong
        >
      </h2>
      <p class="p">
        My biggest strengths are honesty, kindness and perseverance, and I
        believe each one of these will help me to go through this new learning
        journey. <br />
        I know it wont be easy and there will be many obstacles but I am certain
        that I can do it.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2">
        <strong
          >2. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?</strong
        >
      </h2>
      <p class="p">
        Sometimes I focused too much in one thing and I get stuck at it, I want
        everything to look so nice and be well done that I spend 10 hours in
        something that should take 2 hours. <br />
        I know that this is definitely my biggest problem to when I am learning
        something new and that I have to work on it.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2">
        <strong
          >3. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were</strong
        >
      </h2>
      <p class="p">
        I used to do car sales when I came to New Zealand and that means I would
        depend on the Service team to get the vehicles ready for delivery. It
        was always complicated to get a car ready and that was something the
        service team didn’t really enjoy doing. <br />
        My strategi was to always be very kind and patient with the team and try
        to make them understand that we both needed each other so everything
        could run smoothly. <br />At the end of the day a team is like an
        engine, everything department has to work for the whole piece to run.
