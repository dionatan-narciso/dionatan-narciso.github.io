        <strong>JavaScript and its relation to HTML and CSS</strong>
      </h2>
      On these days creating a website can be quite simple, by using HTML and
      CSS you can develop a web browser with a structure, a menu, colours, a few
      links, etc... That is what HTML and CSS will do, one is a structure ‘HTML’
      and the other is the style ‘CSS’. <br />
      But what if you want something a little bit more interactive? Well, that’s
      when JS comes in place. JavaScript will create the dynamic and interaction
      of these elements on the browser, <br />
      like when you click on something, what happens then? Does it change
      colour? Does it make a sound or calculate something? <br />
      That’s what JS is and that’s why having a structure and styling are not
      enough, you also need a Functionality!

        <strong>Control Flow & Loops</strong>
      </h2>

      <p class="p">
        Control flow is basically reading a book, from top to bottom, it starts
        from the first line and it ends at the last line. Loop is telling the
        computer to repeat something before you get to that last line, like,
        lets imagine you are reading a book, <br />
        and in the middle of the book it tells you to return to a certain page
        to compare something that you have already seen, that’s basically a
        loop, going back to check or execute something before it ends.

        <strong>What is the DOM?</strong>
      </h2>
      <p class="p">
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface
        for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of
        documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. In the DOM
        specification, the term "document" is used in the broad sense -
        increasingly, XML is being used as a way of representing many different
        kinds of information that may be stored in diverse systems, and much of
        this would traditionally be seen as data rather than as documents.
        Nevertheless, XML presents this data as documents, and the DOM may be
        used to manage this data. With the Document Object Model, programmers
        can build documents, navigate their structure, and add, modify, or
        delete elements and content. Anything found in an HTML or XML document
        can be accessed, changed, deleted, or added using the Document Object
        Model, with a few exceptions - in particular, the DOM interfaces for the
        XML internal and external subsets have not yet been specified.<br />

        <strong>Arrays vs Objects </strong>
      </h2>
      <p class="p">
        Objects are used to represent a “thing” in your code. That could be a
        person, a car, a building, a book, a character in a game — basically
        anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of characteristics.
        <br />In objects, these characteristics are called properties that
        consist of a key and a value. Arrays are used whenever we want to create
        and store a list of multiple items in a single variable. Arrays are
        especially useful <br />
        when creating ordered collections where items in the collection can be
        accessed by their numerical position in the list.
