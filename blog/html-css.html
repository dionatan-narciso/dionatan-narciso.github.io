      <h2 class="h2"><strong>What are classes and Id's?</strong></h2>

      <p class="p">
        image.png Classes and id's are attributes used in HTML and CSS with the
        purpose of styling web pages
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2"><strong>How do you apply classes and Id's?</strong></h2>

      <p class="p">
        At first it can be complicated to understand which one you should use as
        they work in a very similar way<br />
        A class can be used to select a group of elements, like multiple
        paragraphs that could share the same style<br />
        An ID can only select a single element and cannot be used to style
        multiple elements
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2"><strong>What are the best practices?</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">
        There are no rules for which you should use one rather than the other as
        both Id's and classes have a similar purpose but with time<br />
        chosing one over the other will leave you with cleaner code.
