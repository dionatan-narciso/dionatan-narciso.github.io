        <strong>1. What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</strong>
      </h2>

      <p class="p">
        I want to become a good software developer and have enough knowledge to
        be able to grow financially and have my own company.
      </p>

          >2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning</strong
        >
      </h2>

      <p class="p">
        My strengths are definitely my desire to learn and persistency to not
        give up on something that I yet canâ€™t understand, which can be also my
        weakness as I can spend too much time trying to learn something on my
        own instead of seeking for help.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2">
        <strong
          >3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to
          see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong
        >
      </h2>
      <p class="p">
        I consider myself to be a lonely person, I try to fix things and learn
        alone which I know can be harmful for my development. I think being more
        social is something I would like to develop.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2">

          programme.
        </strong>
      </h2>
      <p class="p">
        I will commit to do my work in time and always communicate with my
        colleagues. I believe that we all have limitations but a good
        communication can be the key for everything.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2">
        <strong
          >5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely
          way</strong
        >
      </h2>
      <p class="p">
        I believe having the Facilitators on Discord is a very easy and friendly
        way of asking for help which Ill be seeking when things are not working
        out and I cannot understand something on my own even after good
        research.

      <p class="p">
        I expect the team to be patient and kind during this new journey of my
        life
