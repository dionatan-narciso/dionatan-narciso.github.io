        <strong>Problem Solving</strong>

        <strong>When I felt blocked on a simple problem:</strong>
      </h2>
      <p class="p">
        Assign a value to an existing property was something that took some of
        my time, even though it was very simples I don’t know why I couldn’t get
        it. <br />
        I solved it by Google search and that made me understand that maybe and
        only maybe I over complicate things.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2">
        <strong>Solving a problem with style</strong>
      </h2>
      <p class="p">
        The one I was proud the most was to return a function with a given
        array. The problem solving I tried was by simple trying something that I
        believed to be right and it actually worked, <br />
        that definitely made me feel good about myself and realise I am capable
        of doing things I’ve never imaged I would.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2">
        <strong>Problem-solving techniques</strong>
      </h2>
      <ul id="pslist">
        <li><strong>Pseudocode: </strong></li>
        <p class="p">
          I feel ok with this one. I think it is still quite complicated to
          imagine what the solution will be to actually write down what I have
          to do.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Trying something:</strong></li>
        <p class="p">
          Definitely my go to, I realise that I always try to solve the problem
          myself for a good 10/15 min before I do any other kind of search.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong></li>
        <p class="p">
          I find this method very fun and sometimes it does work, I cant say I
          remember to do that all the time but when I do it is helpful.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Reading error messages:</strong></li>
        <p class="p">
          I use Reading error messages quiet a lot and I find it very easy to
          understand and resourceful at times.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Console.logging:</strong></li>
        <p class="p">
          Not what I use the most I have to say, I still don’t fell very
          confident about using console.log even though I know I should be using
          it much more.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Googling:</strong></li>
        <p class="p">
          Googling is one of the first things I’ll do when I actually have to
          look somewhere else for a solution.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong></li>
        <p class="p">
          I don’t think I feel confident about asking for help, most of the
          times I think I am going to look dumb on a problem. That would be my
          last resource.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong></li>
        <p class="p">
          I am trying to get more confortable asking coaches for help, I can’t
          say that is something I do easily but I think with time I am getting
          more relaxed in sharing my frustrations.
