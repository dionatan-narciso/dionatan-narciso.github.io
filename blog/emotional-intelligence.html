        <strong>What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong>
      </h2>

      <p class="p">
        • For my understanding emotional intelligence is the ability to identify
        your own emotions or someone else’s feelings and have the ability to use
        this information to guide your behaviour and actions.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2">
        <strong>• How is EQ different to IQ?</strong>
      </h2>

      <p class="p">
        • EQ is based on your emotion intelligence, meaning how you deal with
        your feelings and the ability to understand other’s feelings. • IQ is
        based on your ability to understand the process in different tasks,
        <br />like the ability to easily learn and understand a different
        language on coding for ex.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2">
        <strong>• Why is EQ important?</strong>
      </h2>
      <p class="p">
        • EQ is important for many reasons, being able to balance your emotions
        and understand what is going on with you or other people can help how
        you act in a team environment or in personal regards. <br />
        It is also a very important skill for managing as it will allow you to
        manage the performance of the work other people are doing for you.
